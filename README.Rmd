# ARL_package

This package contains a single function: Make_palindrome.  A palindrome number is the same when read forward or backward e.g. 121.  

One obscure mathematical recreation is to make non-palindrome numbers palindromic through a process of reversing and adding.

Choose a number

*If itâ€™s a palindrome, then stop
*If not, reverse the number and add to the original number
*Go to step 2.

For example: 12 + 21 = 33

## First things first

`Make_palindrome` is a toy project and is still under development. You can install the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, install, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("TonyLadson/ARLpackage")
```

## Take it for a spin

Try Make_palindrome(89)

```{r example}
library(ARLpackage)
 
Make_palindrome(89)
```
